# GraphQLRestructure

## Description

This project started as a full stack MERN application, and it was my job to restructure it to utilize GraphQL. 
The motivation behind this project was to demonstrate how GraphQL can be used to specify queries instead of using a full API call every time you want to do something.
As someone who does work on both the front and back end of these projects, I can see why GraphQL is a valuable tool to learn.
